// Homework Problems
// Try to declare meaningful variables of each type. Eg - a variable named age should be a numeric type (int or float) not byte.

// Make a program that takes the radius of a circle as input, calculates its radius and area and prints it as output to the user.
// Make a program that prints the table of a number that is input by the user. 
// (HINT - You will have to write 10 lines for this but as we proceed in the course you will be studying about ‘LOOPS’ that will simplify your work A LOT!)
